Flying Circus OpenVPN gateway
=============================

How to use
----------

- Transfer the client configuration via SSH from /etc/local/openvpn to the
  client computer.

- Import client configuration into the OpenVPN client of your choice.
  Certificates are already included. The user only needs to provide a FC login
  to connect.

Tunables
--------

- The OpenVPN gateway should get a nice DNS name for its FE address(es).
  Configure the same name as reverse for FE in the directory to get it mentioned
  in the generated client config.

- The file /etc/local/openvpn/networks.json contains networks from which the
  OpenVPN server allocates client addresses, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.
  Adjust in case of address conflicts. To get masquerading, the IPv4 network
  must be a subnet in the 10.0.0.0/8 range and the IPv6 network in fc00::7
  (ULA).

- Extra routes (CIDR notation) in the network configuration file will be pushed
  to the client. This allows the OpenVPN server to create connectivity to
  auxiliary networks).

  Example::

    extraroutes: ["172.22.1.0/16" "2a02:248:101:61::/64"]
